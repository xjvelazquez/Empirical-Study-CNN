# Empirical-Study-CNN
## Abstract
Convolutional neural networks is a class of deep
neural networks that is commonly applied to analyze visual
data. I will be studying the performance of different
architectures of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to
gauge what tweaks and tuning brings about the best result for
our models. I will be constructing a custom designed CNN to
compare to the Alexnet and GoogLeNet architectures. I will be
training all models on the CIFAR-10 dataset.
